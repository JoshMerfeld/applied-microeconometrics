\textbf{Due date: Friday, October 13th at 11:59pm}

For this assignment, you will be using the \texttt{village\_economiccensus.rds} data in the assignment folder. I have done a bit of cleaning for you, including a variable \texttt{year} that is the year of the census. I have renamed all of the economic census variables to drop the \texttt{ec\_} prefix. You can find the definition of the variables on the SHRUG website, from which I downloaded the data. The data dictionary for the economic census is \href{https://docs.devdatalab.org/SHRUG-Metadata/Economic\%20Census/Tables/ec90-metadata/}{\textcolor{kdisgreen}{here}}.

The dataset is in an R-specific format. You can load it into R using the \texttt{readRDS()} function.

Below is a list of tasks. I would like you to create a properly formated PDF file, as if it were a paper. This means that raw code should not appear in the PDF file. When you estimate a regression, the choice of standard errors is up to you. However, I'd like you to justify your choice of standard errors in each case. For 3. and 4., please treat the data as a simple cross-section.

Tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create some new variables:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Proportion of total employment that is women
  \item
    Proportion of total employment that is government employment
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Create a table that shows the mean of these variables by year
\item
  Create a figure of your choice. The choice of x and y variables are completely up to you. Describe the figure and interpret it.
\item
  Using OLS, estimate a regression (and present the output) that allows you to extract the exact same information as the information in the table you created in step 2. Please make sure to interpret the output.
\item
  Estimate a poisson regression that shows the relationship between the total number of female employees (on the left-hand side) and the following variables on the right-hand side: total employment, proportion of employment that is government employment, and year. Present the output of this regression. Please make sure to interpret the output.
\item
  The data also has an additional variable in it, called \texttt{shrid2}. This variable is a village identifier. It turns out that the data I've given you is \emph{panel data}, with the exact same villages observed across four separate years. Re-estimate your regressions in 3. and 4. using this new information. How does this change any of the decisions you made in 3. and 4.? Please make sure to interpret the output and explain any changes you made.
\end{enumerate}

As before, please submit the following files:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your R Markdown file
\item
  Your knitted PDF file
\item
  Any other scripts you used to complete the assignment
\end{itemize}
