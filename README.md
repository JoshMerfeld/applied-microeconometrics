## Weekly slides

You can find the slides (and any data we will be using) for each week under their respective folders (weeks/). Most weeks will have just a single slide deck. Note that in each week's folder, you can also find the raw .Rmd file that I used to create the slides. You might find these helpful, though you are by no means required to look at them.

- Week 1: Week 1 has two slides. 
  - You can find the slides for the first class [here](weeks/week1/week1a.pdf).
  - You can find the slides for the second class [here](weeks/week1/week1b.pdf).
  - You can find the data for the second class in the week 1 folder or by clicking [here](weeks/week1/data.csv) (you can download the csv in the upper-right-hand corner).

## Assignments

I will also post your assignments here, under the [assignments folder](assignments/).

- Assignment 1: Due during week 2.
  - You can find the assignment in the [assignment 1 folder](assignments/assignment1/)
