## Differences-in-differences

- More commonly referred to as "DID" or "diff-in-diff"
  - Classic reference: Card and Krueger (1994)

- Most common method, likely because data requirements are least stringent

- Example in _Mostly Harmless_: offering credit to banks during the Great Depression (Richardson and Troost, 2009)
  - Set up: Two different federal reserve banks lent to neighborhood banks in Mississippi
  - Atlanta fed favored lending to banks in trouble
  - St. Louis fed favored the exact opposite





## Richardson and Troost (2009) - Mississippi dividing line

## Did the policy of extra lending save banks?

- Basic idea: compare what happened to Atlanta fed banks (southern Mississippi) with St. Louis fed banks (northern Mississippi)

- Could compare after lending, but what's the assumption here? \pause

- Assumption: same levels before intervention (very strict assumption)





## In fact, pre-intervention levels are different!

\center

## Did the policy of extra lending save banks?

- Instead, compare _changes_ from before to after treatment

- Assumption: parallel trends

- If valid, the fact the districts were different prior to the treatment isn't a problem





## "Parallel trends"
\vspace{-2mm}
\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.55\columnwidth]{assets/dd2}





## Why is it "differences in differences"?

- Difference 1: St. Louis post minus St. Louis pre

- Difference 2: Atlanta post minus Atlanta pre

- Difference-in-differences: Difference 2 minus difference 1





## "Differences in differences" graphically
\vspace{-1mm}
\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.55\columnwidth]{assets/dd1}





## Parallel trends assumption

- The key assumption in differences-in-differences is the parallel trends assumption
  - _If the treated group had not been treated, it would have changed by the same amount ("had the same trend") as the comparison group._

- This is a counterfactual assumption: We cannot explicitly test it

- What can we do instead? \pause
  - We can test trends _before_ treatment
  - Or in the case of this article, _after_ treatment!





## Richardson and Troost (2009) - Testing the assumption

\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{assets/mississippi2}





## Estimating diff-in-diff empirically

- Can be estimated in a straightforward regression:
\begin{gather} Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 TREAT_i + \beta_2 POST_t + \beta_3 (POST_t \times TREAT_i) + \varepsilon_{it} \end{gather}
\pause
  - $\beta_0$: pre mean for the comparison group
  - $\beta_1$: difference in the pre mean between the treated and untreated group
  - $\beta_2$: difference in means between the pre and post period for the comparison group
  - $\beta_3$: difference-in-differences estimate
    - This is the difference in the change from pre to post for the treated group relative to the comparison group

## Estimating diff-in-diff empirically - adding controls

- Can add control variables
\begin{gather} Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 TREAT_i + \beta_2 POST_t + \\
                \beta_3 (POST_t \times TREAT_i) + X_{it} + \varepsilon_{it} \end{gather}

- Adding controls can help control for differing trends ("conditional" parallel trends)

- Note: the interpretation of $\beta_0$ is no longer the same; others stay the same







## Standard errors in differences-in-differences
\vfill
- Card and Krueger did not cluster standard errors
  - In fact, that would have been difficult because they really only had two "clusters"!
  -  But their robust standard errors are likely underestimated due to the clustering
\vfill
- Classic reference: Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004)
  - "How Much Should We Trust Differences-in-Differences Estimates?"
\vfill







## Standard errors in differences-in-differences
\vfill
- Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004) suggest three possibilities:
  1. Cluster at the group level
  2. Block bootstrap (not going to discuss)
  3. Aggregating data into one pre and one post period (event studies later)
\vfill
- Let's go through these
\vfill







## Clustering
\vfill
- The most common approach: cluster standard errors
\vfill
- Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) show that this is problematic with few clusters
  - "Bootstrap-based improvements for inference with clustered errors"
\vfill
- The authors look at many possible approaches and find that the "wild cluster bootstrap" seems to perform best, on average
\vfill







## Wild cluster bootstrap
\vfill
- The wild cluster bootstrap is a "non-parametric" bootstrap
  - I'll do the non-cluster as an example. Software makes this easy!
\vfill
- Suppose we are interested in the following regression:
$$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i $$

- We want to test whether $\beta_1 = 0$ and we have relatively few clusters (say between 5 and 30)
\vfill







## Wild cluster bootstrap

\begin{gather}\label{wcreg} y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i \end{gather}

1. Estimate above regression and obtain $\hat{\beta}$, $\hat{\varepsilon}$

2. Impose the null hypothesis ($\beta_1 = 0$) and estimate the restricted regression:
\begin{gather}\label{wcregres} \tilde{y}_i = \tilde{\beta}_0 + \tilde{\varepsilon}_i \end{gather}







## Wild cluster bootstrap

3. Bootstrap replications:
  - Use equation \autoref{wcregres} to generate $\tilde{y}_i^b$, where $\tilde{y}_i^b = \tilde{\beta}_0^{b} + \tilde{\varepsilon}_i^{b}$
    - Rademacher weights: The randomness comes from either adding $\hat{\varepsilon}_i$ or $-\hat{\varepsilon}_i$ with equal probability
  - Estimate:
\begin{gather}\label{wcregB} \tilde{y}_i^{b} = \tilde{\beta}_0^{b*} + \tilde{\beta}_1^{b*}x_i + \tilde{\varepsilon}_i^{b*} \end{gather}

  - Calculate the t-statistic for the bootstrap replication:
\begin{gather}\label{wctstat} t^{b*} = \frac{\tilde{\beta}_1^{b*}}{\sqrt{\tilde{V}^{b*}}} \end{gather}







## Wild cluster bootstrap
Two-tailed test:

- Reject the null hypothesis if 
  $$|t^{b*}| > |t^{*}|\;\mathrm{for}\;b = 1, \dots, B,$$ 
where $t^{*}$ is the t-statistic from the \textit{original regression}.

- P-value across $B$ bootstrap samples is:
  \begin{gather}\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \mathbb{I}(|t^{b*}| > |t^{*}|),\end{gather}

where $\mathbb{I}$ is the indicator function.







## Implementing WCB in `R`
- Thankfully there's a package that allows us to do this!
  - `fwildclusterboot` (Friedrich, 2019)

- This package works with `fixest` objects!

- Let's use the `castle.dta` data in the GitHub repo to test this







## Implementing WCB in `R`

```{r wcb1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
library(haven) # to load .dta files
df <- read_dta("castle.dta")
head(df)
# key variables: state, year, cdl ("treatment"), and homicide_c (outcome)
# homicide_c to rate (per 100,000 people)
df$homicide_c <- (df$homicide_c/df$population)*100000
# and log
df$homicide_c <- log(df$homicide_c)
```







## Implementing WCB in `R`

```{r wcb2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
# Note: this is not differences-in-differences. 
# Just an example of the wild cluster bootstrap with fwildclusterboot
reg1 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl, data = df, cluster = "state")
summary(reg1)
```







## Implementing WCB in `R`

```{r wcb3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
reg1 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl, data = df, cluster = "state")
boot_reg <- boottest(
                    reg1, 
                    clustid = c("state"), 
                    param = "cdl", 
                    B = 10000,
                    type = "rademacher" # default weighting, by the way
                    )
boot_reg
```







## Add controls

```{r wcb4, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
reg1 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt, data = df, cluster = "state")
reg1
boot_reg <- boottest(
                    reg1, 
                    clustid = c("state"), 
                    param = "cdl", 
                    B = 10000,
                    type = "rademacher" # default weighting, by the way
                    )
boot_reg
```







## Multi-way clustering, too!

```{r wcb5, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
reg1 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt, data = df, cluster = c("state", "year"))
reg1
boot_reg <- boottest(
                    reg1, 
                    clustid = c("state"), 
                    param = "cdl", 
                    B = 10000,
                    type = "rademacher" # default weighting, by the way
                    )
boot_reg
```







## Finally, Webb weights (Webb, 2023) -- but using Rademacher weights is the norm

```{r wcb6, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
reg1 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt, data = df, cluster = c("state", "year"))
reg1
boot_reg <- boottest(
                    reg1, 
                    clustid = c("state"), 
                    param = "cdl", 
                    B = 10000,
                    type = "webb"
                    )
boot_reg
```







## Some thoughts on clustering
\vfill
- If you have more than ~30 clusters, you can probably just cluster at the group level
  - We see that the standard errors are very similar in the state examples above
\vfill
- Otherwise, consider using an alternative approach
  - Also important when clusters have wildly different sample sizes, or where the treated clusters are relatively few (Moulton, 1990)
\vfill
- Alternative approach with only one treated cluster: randomization inference
\vfill 







## Randomization inference in Buchmueller, DiNardo, and Valletta (2011)
- They are interested in the change in insurance coverage in Hawaii relative to other states:
\begin{gather} Y_{ist}=X_{ist}\beta^t+Z_{st}\gamma^t+H_{it}\delta^t+\phi_{st}+\eta_{it} \end{gather}

- They calculate the change as: $\Delta=\delta^1-\delta^0$

- The idea: see where the Hawaii effect sits in the distribution of the same effect across *all US states*
  - "Placebo" effects
  - Note that this is not true "randomization" inference
    - I'll show you an example with one of my papers in a minute

## Randomization inference in Merfeld (2023)
\vfill
- I'm interested in the effects of pollution on agricultural productivity in India
\vfill
- I have villages, which are nested within districts
  - I cluster on villages
\vfill
- Alternative: randomly assign pollution to villages *within the same district* and compare my effects to the distribution of effects
\vfill

## Placebo tests for the parallel trends assumption
\vfill
- Above, we looked at the parallel trends assumption graphically in Richardson and Troost (2009)
\vfill
- Another common way is to look at *leads* of treatment
  - In my paper, for example, pollution next year should not affect agricultural productivity this year
\vfill







## Leads of pollution in Merfeld (2023)
```{r yieldtableleads, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
yield3ivmain_lead <- readRDS("assets/yield3ivmain_lead.rds")
# Table
colnames(yield3ivmain_lead) <- c("(1)", "(2)")
rownames(yield3ivmain_lead) <- c("particulate matter (one-year lead)", "",
                                  "particulate matter (two-year lead)", "",
                                  "weather (expanded)",
                                  "fixed effects:", "village", "year",
                                  "F", 
                                  "observations")
kable(
      yield3ivmain_lead,
      align = "cc", booktabs = TRUE, linesep = ""
      ) %>%
  footnote(
           "Note: Standard errors are in parentheses and are clustered at the village level. * p<0.10 ** p<0.05 *** p<0.01", 
            general_title = "",
            threeparttable = TRUE,
            footnote_as_chunk = TRUE
            ) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "7.4cm") %>%
  column_spec(c(2:3),width = "2cm") %>%
  row_spec(c(8), hline_after = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(c(6), bold = TRUE) %>%
  kable_classic_2()

```







## Convincing the reader is like writing a good story
\vfill
- When you're writing a diff-in-diff paper, think about the possible threats to your identification strategy
\vfill
- Then, think about how you can convince the reader that your strategy is valid
  - Use placebos: is there somewhere we shouldn't expect an effect?
  - In the case of my paper, the leads convinced some seminar participants!
\vfill
- You can likewise think of heterogeneity we would *expect* to see, and test for that!
\vfill






# Fixed and random effects

## Before moving on to some of the new literature...
\vfill
- Let's talk about fixed and random effects
  - Fixed effects will be important for the upcoming discussions
\vfill
- Some nice (but old) slides from Oscar Tores-Reyna [\textcolor{kdisgreen}{here}](https://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/Panel101.pdf).
\vfill






## Panel data
\vfill
- Both fixed and random effects are used in panel data
  - Panel data: data with multiple observations for each unit
  - Examples: individuals, firms, countries, etc.
\vfill
- In our previous example of homicide and castle doctrine laws: unit is the state!
\vfill






## Panel data
```{r panel1, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
df <- read_dta("castle.dta")
# homicide_c to rate
df$homicide_c <- (df$homicide_c/df$population)*1000
# and log
df$homicide_c <- log(df$homicide_c)
ggplot(df) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = homicide_c, color = state)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Homicide rate (log)", title = "Homicide rate by state and year") +
  # and add x labels for each year
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000:2010))
```






## Fixed effects
\vfill
- Fixed effects are a way to control for omitted variables
  - However there is a key assumption: the omitted variable is time-invariant
\vfill
- Fixed effects are also called "within" effects
  - Why? Because we are looking at the variation within each unit
\vfill
- The regression is of the form:
\begin{gather} y_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta x_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}, \end{gather}

where $\alpha_i$ is the fixed effect for unit $i$. Note the subscript! No t!
\vfill






## Fixed effects, empirically
\vfill
- Empirically, what are fixed effects doing?
  - They are subtracting the mean of **each unit** from the outcome variable
\vfill
- In a regression, we add a dummy variable for each unit
  - We have to leave out one dummy variable, though
  - Software will do this for us!
  - Note that the intercept is usually meaningless in this case
\vfill
- Cannot include time-invariant variables in the regression
  - Why? Because the fixed effect will absorb them!
\vfill






## Fixed effects with feols
- `feols` makes this easy on us. Let's return to our previous example.

```{r fe1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
reg1 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt, data = df, cluster = c("state"))
reg2 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt | state, data = df, cluster = c("state"))
etable(reg1, reg2,
        # standard errors, digits, fit statistics, put SE below coefficients (the norm)
        digits = 3, fitstat = "", se.below = TRUE, 
        # change significance codes to the norm
        signif.code = c("***" = 0.01, "**" = 0.05, "*" = 0.1))
```






## Just a quick note: wild cluster bootstrap still works!
```{r fe2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
# need to use a numeric variable for the bootstrap. sid is in our data, thankfully.
reg1 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt | sid, data = df, cluster = c("sid"))
reg1
boot_reg <- boottest(
                    reg1, 
                    clustid = c("sid"), # note that it requires a numeric variable!
                    param = "cdl", 
                    B = 10000
                    )
boot_reg
```






## Fixed effects are the norm with "differences-in-differences"
\vfill
- It's not quite the same as the canonical differences-in-differences model
\vfill
- We redefine treatment for the same unit
  - Before treatment, the value is zero, and after it is One
  - Note that this is different from the canonical model, where the value is zero for the comparison group and one for the treated group
\vfill
- In fact, the regression we just saw is a differences-in-differences model of this form!
  - In practice, we often tend to add time fixed effects, too:
\begin{gather} y_{it} = \alpha_i + \delta_{t} + \beta x_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}, \end{gather}
\vfill






## The "effect" of castle doctrine laws, two-way fixed effects
```{r fe3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
reg1 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt | state, data = df, cluster = c("state"))
reg2 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt | state + year, data = df, cluster = c("state"))
etable(reg1, reg2,
        # standard errors, digits, fit statistics, put SE below coefficients (the norm)
        digits = 3, fitstat = "", se.below = TRUE, 
        # change significance codes to the norm
        signif.code = c("***" = 0.01, "**" = 0.05, "*" = 0.1))
```






## Random effects
\vfill
- Before turning to recent issues discovered with the two-way fixed effects estimator, let's talk about random effects
\vfill
- Random effects are a way to capture the heterogeneity across units
  - The key is that this heterogeneity is *random* and uncorrelated with the predictors in the model
\vfill
- This is really a way to capture the *variance* across units
  - In practice, this absorbs some of the variance, increasing precision (but at the cost of the assumption above)
\vfill






## Random effects in `R`
```{r fe4, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
library(lme4)
reg1 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt, data = df, cluster = "state")
# note iid standard errors for simplicity for random effects 
# (can use other packages to change the vcov calculation if we think assumptions aren't exactly true...)
reg2 <- lmer(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt + (1 | state), data = df) 
reg3 <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + log(income) + unemployrt | state, data = df, cluster = "state")
modelsummary(list("None" = reg1, "RE" = reg2, "FE" = reg3), gof_omit = ".*", 
              output = "markdown", coef_omit = c(-2,-3,-4,-5),
              coef_rename = c("cdl" = "Castle laws", "log(population)" = "Population (log)", 
                              "log(income)" = "Income (log)", "unemployrt" = "Unemployment rate"))
```






## Random effects
\vfill
Some things about random effects relative to vanilla OLS (not fixed effects):
\vfill

- The random effects estimator is asymptotically more efficient than OLS if there is unit-level heterogeneity: $\mathbb{E}(V_{RE})<\mathbb{E}(V_{OLS})$
  
  - In practice with finite samples, not necessarily
\vfill

- In expectation, coefficients are the same: $\mathbb{E}(\beta_{RE}) = \mathbb{E}(\beta_{OLS})$
  
  - Random effects is estimated using (feasible) generalized least squares, which essentially reweights the observations
\vfill






# Bias in TWFE

## Bias in TWFE
\vfill
- Recently, a number of papers have shown that the two-way fixed effects estimator can be... problematic
\vfill
- We have been discussing differences-in-differences with TWFE of the following form:
\begin{gather} y_{it} = \alpha_i + \delta_{t} + \beta D_{it} + \gamma x_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}, \end{gather}
where $D_{it}$ is a dummy variable for treatment.
\vfill

- If there are only two time periods and one group receives treatment in only one period, this is not a problem!
  - The Card and Krueger setup is not an issue with TWFE
\vfill





## TWFE and differential treatment timing
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
\vspace{1cm}
- The real issue is when treatment is staggered across time
  - For example, if treatment is introduced in different years for different states
\vspace{1cm}

## Goodman-Bacon (2021), *Journal of Econometrics*
\vfill
- Goodman-Bacon lays out the problem (as does Scott in *CI*)
\vfill
- Suppose we have three groups and three time periods
  - Group 1 is treated before period 2 (Goodman-Bacon calls this group *k*)
  - Group 2 is treated before period 3 (Goodman-Bacon calls this group *l*)
  - Group 3 is never treated (Goodman-Bacon calls this group *U*)
\vfill
- If we are willing to assume treatment effect *homogeneity*, then we have no problems!
  - Are you willing to assume this?
\vfill





## Goodman-Bacon (2021)
\vfill
- Goodman-Bacon shows that the overall treatment effect is a *weighted average* of treatment effects from every possible 2x2 comparison where treatment status doesn't change:
  - Group 1 vs group 2
  - Group 1 vs group 3
  - Group 2 vs group 1
  - Group 2 vs group 3
\vfill
- These weights are a function of two things:
  - Group sizes
  - Variance in treatment
\vfill





## Goodman-Bacon (2021)
\center
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{assets/bacon}





## Goodman-Bacon (2021)
\vfill
- He shows there are three relevant comparisons:
\begin{align} \hat{\beta}_{kU}^{2x2}&\equiv \left(\bar{y}_k^{POST(k)}-\bar{y}_k^{PRE(k)}\right) - \left(\bar{y}_U^{POST(k)}-\bar{y}_U^{PRE(k)}\right) \\
              \hat{\beta}_{kl}^{2x2,k}&\equiv \left(\bar{y}_k^{MID(k,l)}-\bar{y}_k^{PRE(k)}\right) - \left(\bar{y}_l^{MID(k,l)}-\bar{y}_l^{PRE(k)}\right) \\
              \hat{\beta}_{kl}^{2x2,l}&\equiv \left(\bar{y}_l^{POST(l)}-\bar{y}_l^{MID(k,l)}\right) - \left(\bar{y}_k^{POST(l)}-\bar{y}_k^{MID(k,l)}\right), \end{align}
where $k$ and $l$ are treated groups, and $U$ is the untreated group.
\vfill





## Goodman-Bacon (2021)
\vfill
- The DD estimator is a weighted average of all these comparisons.
\vfill
- Generalizing to $K$ time periods:
\begin{gather} \hat{\beta}^{DD}=\sum_{k\neq U}s_{kU}\hat{\beta}_{kU}^{2x2}+\sum_{k\neq U}\sum_{l>k}\left[s_{kl}^k\hat{\beta}_{kl}^{2x2,k}+s_{kl}^l\hat{\beta}_{kl}^{2x2,l} \right], \end{gather}
where $s_{ij}$ is the weight for the comparison between groups $i$ and $j$.
\vfill





## Goodman-Bacon (2021)
The weights:
\begin{align} s_{kU}&=\frac{(n_k+n_U)^2n_{kU}(1-n_{kU})\bar{D}_k(1-\bar{D}_k)}{\hat{V}^D} \\
              s_{kl}^k&=\frac{\left((n_k+n_l)(1-\bar{D}_l)\right)^2n_{kl}(1-n_{kl})\frac{\bar{D}_k-\bar{D}_l}{1-\bar{D}_l}\frac{1-\bar{D}_k}{1-\bar{D}_k}}{\hat{V}^D} \\
              s_{kl}^l&=\frac{\left((n_k+n_l)(\bar{D}_k)\right)^2n_{kl}(1-n_{kl})\frac{\bar{D}_l}{\bar{D}_k}\frac{\bar{D}_k-\bar{D}_l}{\bar{D}_k}}{\hat{V}^D} \end{align}

- Note how the variance of treatment affects the weights! "Changing the number or spacing of time periods changes the weights" (Goodman-Bacon).
  - Even if the treatment effect is constant, changing the length of the panel can change the weighted average if different groups have different treatment effects.





## de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille (2020), *American Economic Review*
\vfill
- de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille (2020) more explicitly show the problem with weights.
\vfill
- Let $w_{g,t}$ represent the weight for group $g$ at time $t$, $\Delta_{g,t}$ represent the average treatment effect for the same, and $N_1$ represent the total number of treated units at the time:
\begin{gather} \beta_{FE} = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{(g,t):D_{g,t}=1}\frac{N_{g,t}}{N_1}w_{g,t}\Delta_{g,t}\right] \end{gather}

- The fixed effect estimator is a weighted average of these treatment effects.
  - But how do we get the weights?
\vfill





## de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille (2020)
\vfill
- Let $D_{g,t}$ represent treatment status of group $g$ at time $t$:
\begin{gather} D_{g,t} = \alpha + \gamma_g + \lambda_t + \varepsilon_{g,t}, \end{gather}
where $\gamma_g$ is the group fixed effect and $\lambda_t$ is the time fixed effect.
\vfill

- It turns out that the average residual *is not zero*, so let's rescale it by its mean:
\begin{gather} w_{g,t} = \frac{\varepsilon_{g,t}}{\sum_{(g,t):D_{g,t}=1}\frac{N_{g,t}}{N_1}\varepsilon_{g,t}} \end{gather}

- Since $\varepsilon_{g,t}$ can be positive or negative, this means that the weights can be negative!
\vfill





## de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille (2020)
\vfill
- The problem is an *extrapolation* problem
  - Essentially, "the regression predicts a treatment probability larger than the one in that cell" (de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille)
\vfill
- Note that if the treatment effect is constant, then the weighted average is always the same, no matter the weights
  - But if the treatment effect is not constant, then the weighted average can be different from the true average
\vfill





## Back to Bacon-Goodman
\vfill
- Let's return to Bacon-Goodman's formulation
\vfill
- What happens if we have a "control" group in a later period that is treated in an earlier period?
\begin{align} \begin{split} \hat{\delta}_{lk}^{2x2} = &ATT_{l,POST(l)} \\
                                                    + &\Delta Y_l^0(Post(l), MID) - \Delta Y_k^0(Post(l), MID) \\
                                                    - &(ATT_k(Post) - ATT_k(Mid)) \end{split} \end{align}

- The first line is *what we want*
- The second line is parallel-trends bias
- The third line is bias due to heterogeneity in time!
  - Even with parallel trends, this third line can cause deviations from the true ATT






## Enough math, what to do?
\vfill
- That's enough math. Let's talk about what we can actually do!
\vfill
- Let's go back to the `castle.dta` dataset
  - Cheng and Hoekstra (2013), *Journal of Human Resources*
\vfill
- Let's use the information in Cunningham's book
\vfill






## Cheng and Hoekstra (2013), *Journal of Human Resources*
\vfill
- The "castle doctrine" laws essentially make lethal force "more" legal
\vfill
- Recall the changes we made: turn homicide into a rate (per 100,000 people) and take the log:
\vfill
```{r ch1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
library(haven) # to load .dta files
df <- read_dta("castle.dta")
head(df)
# key variables: state, year, cdl ("treatment"), and homicide_c (outcome)
# homicide_c to rate (per 100,000 people)
df$homicide_c <- (df$homicide_c/df$population)*100000
# and log
df$homicide_c <- log(df$homicide_c)
```
\vfill






## Cheng and Hoekstra (2013), *Journal of Human Resources*
\vfill
- I made some changes to the data, as well
  - I've turned the "treatment" variable (`cdl`) into a dummy variable
\vfill
- We have the issue we ran into above: 
  - Treatment is staggered across time
  - This means that some already-treated units will serve as controls for later-treated units!
\vfill

# where is the treatment?

## Event studies
\vfill
- Event studies are a way to look at the effect of treatment over time
  - We can see if the effect is immediate, or if it takes time to "kick in"
  - We can also see whether there are any pre-trends
\vfill
- Effectively, what we want to do is redefine the time period to be relative to treatment
  - For example, if treatment is introduced in 2005, we want to redefine 2005 as year 0, 2004 as year -1, etc.
  - Let's do this nrow
\vfill






## Event studies
```{r ch6, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
# first, find the year of treatment by state
df <- df %>%
      # group by state ("panel" identifier)

      mutate(year_treat = ifelse(cdl==1, year, NA),
              # first year with treatment

## Let's use the "Bacon decomposition" to look at weighting
\vfill
- This won't allow us to calculate standard errors
\vfill
- This of this as "diagnostics"
\vfill
- We can see how different 2x2 cells have different weights, sometimes markedly so
  - We can also see that different cells have different treatment estimates
\vfill








## Let's try the "Bacon decomposition" - Note the treatment variable *must* be binary
```{r ch14, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
library(bacondecomp)

# syntax:
# bacon(formula, data, id_var, time_var, quietly = F)
bacon <- bacon(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + unemployrt, data = df, id_var = "state", time_var = "year", quietly = F)
bacon$two_by_twos
```








## Get the overall average effect by multiplying weights by estimates
```{r ch15, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
bacon <- bacon(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + unemployrt, data = df, id_var = "state", time_var = "year", quietly = F)
weighted.mean(bacon$two_by_twos$estimate, bacon$two_by_twos$weight)

# compare to TWFE estimate
feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + unemployrt | state + year, data = df, 
              cluster = c("state")) # No weights since Bacon decomp doesn't allow them
```








## We can plot the average effects for the different groups
```{r ch16, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(data = bacon$two_by_twos) +
  geom_point(aes(x = weight, y = estimate, color = type, shape = type)) +
  labs(x = "Weight", y = "Estimate") +
  theme_minimal()
```








## Let's estimate effects using the `did2s` function from Kyle Butts
- bacondecomp is good for diagnostics, but we really want to estimate the ATT with standard errors
\vfill

```{r ch17, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
library(did2s)
```
\vfill

- yname: the outcome variable
- first_stage: formula for first stage, can include fixed effects and covariates, but do not include treatment variable(s)!
- second_stage: This should be the treatment variable or in the case of event studies, treatment variables.
- treatment: This has to be the 0/1 treatment variable that marks when treatment turns on for a unit. If you suspect anticipation, see note above for accounting for this.
- cluster_var: Which variables to cluster on
\vfill








## Let's estimate effects using the `did2s` function from Kyle Butts
```{r ch18, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
library(did2s)
# note that we can use fixest syntax, with FE and with i()!
# can also add weights
did2s <- did2s(data = df, yname = "homicide_c", first_stage = "log(population) + unemployrt | state + year", 
                second_stage = "cdl", treatment = "cdl", cluster_var = "state", weights = "population")
# let's compare it to the vanilla TWFE
twfe <- feols(homicide_c ~ cdl + log(population) + unemployrt | state + year, data = df, 
              cluster = c("state"), weights = df$population)
```








## And the results
```{r ch19, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
# The "correct" results
did2s

# and the TWFE results?
twfe
```








## We can also estimate the event study this way!
```{r ch20a, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
# Estimate
did2s <- did2s(data = df, yname = "homicide_c", first_stage = "log(population) + unemployrt | state + year", 
                second_stage = "i(event_year, ref = -1)", treatment = "cdl", cluster_var = "state", 
                weights = "population")
coefficients <- c(did2s$coefficients[2:10], 0, did2s$coefficients[11:15])
# confidence intervals
lower <- c(confint(did2s)[2:10,1], 0, confint(did2s)[11:15,1])
upper <- c(confint(did2s)[2:10,2], 0, confint(did2s)[11:15,2])
# plot estimates
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = c(-10:4), y = coefficients)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = c(-10:4), ymin = lower, ymax = upper), alpha = 0.2, width = 0.1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Years to treatment", y = "Coefficient (relative to T = -1)") +
  # change x axis to be every year
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = years) +

## Wrapping up TWFE
\vfill
- We've learned how to estimate two-way fixed effects models with `fixest`
  - We've also learned how they can be biased if treatment is staggered
\vfill
- We saw how to use `did2s` to estimate the ATT
  - We also saw how to use `bacondecomp` to look at the weights
\vfill
- A lingering question: TWFE with continuous treatment variables
  - Callaway et al. (2021) and Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille (2023) have some ideas
  - I haven't seen reliable packages for these, though
\vfill
- IVs with TWFE?

# Synthetic control

## Increasing cigarette taxes and discouraging smoking in California (in 1988)
```{r sc1, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, size = "tiny", out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
# Estimate
df <- read_dta("smoking.dta")
df$california <- as.numeric(df$state==3)
dfgraph <- df %>%
            group_by(year, california) %>%
            summarize(cigsale = mean(cigsale))
dfgraph$group <- ifelse(dfgraph$california==1, "California", "Rest of U.S.")
ggplot(dfgraph) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = cigsale, color = group)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d("State", labels = c("California", "Rest of U.S.")) +

  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Cigarette sales (per capita)") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.2))
  
```







## Increasing cigarette taxes and discouraging smoking in California (in 1988)
\vfill
- What if we wanted to figure out whether the law changed smoking in California?
\vfill
- A key problem, similar to Card and Krueger:
  - There is really only one treated unit
  - Many people live in California, obviously, but they are all equally affected by the law
\vfill
- Differences-in-differences is problematic here
  - A single treated cluster!
\vfill
- So what are we to do?
\vfill








## Synthetic control
\vfill
- This is where synthetic control comes in
  - Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), *American Economic Review*
  - Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010), *Journal of the American Statistical Association*
\vfill
- The basic idea: 
  - We want to create a "synthetic" California that is a weighted average of the other states
  - We want to weight the other states so that they look like California before the law
  - We can then compare the synthetic California to the real California after the law
\vfill








## Synthetic control
\vfill
- Synthetic control doesn't just match on pre-treatment outcomes
  - It also matches on pre-treatment trends and covariates
  - This is what makes it different from pure matching
\vfill
