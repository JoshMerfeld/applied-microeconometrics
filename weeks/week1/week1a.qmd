# Introduction

## Introductions
\vfill

- Let's start with a little introduction
\vfill

- Name, year, program, research interests, etc.
  - Why are you taking this class?
\vfill



## Course Overview

\vfill
- Microeconometrics in R
\vfill

- Major themes:
  - Regression analysis review
    - Including maximum likelihood estimation
    - Inference and uncertainty (e.g. bootstrapping)
  - Causal inference
  - Machine learning
  - **Reproducible research**
    - You will be doing assignments in R Markdown
\vfill


## Course Overview

\vfill
- Today will just be a short introduction
\vfill

- For next class, please come with R and R Studio installed on your computer
  - You can find instructions on the syllabus
  - You **must** bring a laptop to class. If you cannot do this, please speak with me.

## Course Overview

- This is the second time I'm teaching this class, so I may make a few changes throughout the semester

- Please check the course website regularly for updates



## Detailed outline (tentative)

\vfill
1. Linear regression (week 2)
   - Inference (confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, bootstrapping, etc.)
   
\vfill
  
2. Maximum likelihood estimation (week 3)
   - Discrete choice (logit, probit, multinomial logit, etc.)
   
\vfill
  
3. Introduction to causality (week 4)
   - Potential outcomes framework
   - Problems with simple regression
   - Why randomization works
   
\vfill



## Detailed outline (tentative)

\vfill
4. Differences-in-differences (weeks 5 and 6)
   - Fixed effects, including two-way fixed effects
   - Event studies
   - Synthetic control
   
\vfill

5. Instrumental variables (weeks 7 and 8)
   - Assumptions
   - IVs in RCTs (LATE)
   - Some examples
   - Weak instruments
   - Bartik (shift-share) instruments
   
\vfill



## Detailed outline (tentative)

\vfill
6. Regression discontinuity (week 9)
   - Canonical regression discontinuity
   - Parametric vs. non-parametric
   
\vfill

7. Machine learning in economics (week 10)
   - ML for prediction (lasso, ridge, elastic net)
   - Cross validation
   - Heterogeneous treatment effects
   - Brief introductionto other supervised ML (time dependent)
   - Note: last year I replaced this with a "class requested" session
   
\vfill



## Grading

1. Homework - coding tasks (55\%)

- The homeworks form the main grading component of the course
- The goal is to get you comfortable with coding *and writing* in R
  - I will also ask you to interpret things to make sure you understand what you are doing statistically
- I expect you to do your homeworks in R Markdown and turn in the code along with a pdf output$^1$
- I expect you will have four or five homeworks throughout the semester
- For those of you without a background in R, the first few weeks will take a bit of effort. It will get easier, I promise.

\footnotesize$^1$ Note: If you have a strong preference for using a different language (e.g. Python), please let me know and we can discuss it. However, you **must** be able to produce a pdf output with your code and results. Using Word is a no-go.



## Grading

1. Final exam (35\%)

- This will be a take-home exam with a mix of theory and coding.


2. Participation (10\%)

- I expect everyone to participate in class. That means asking questions, answering questions, and participating in discussions.



## TA sections
\vfill
- The goal of TA sections is to help you with R and R Markdown
\vfill
- For help with the actual material, please come to my office hours

## Questions?

- Any questions about the course?



## Next up: R and RStudio!

\vfill
- We need to have R and RStudio installed for what's next
  - Another code editor is also acceptable: VS Code, for example
